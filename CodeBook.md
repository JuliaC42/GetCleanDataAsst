## About the original "raw" data

Experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a was assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The features selected for the database came from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

A set of variables were estimated from these signals, but for the purposes of this project
I have only retained:

mean(): Mean value, 
std(): Standard deviation

### Units

Accelerometer features - those including "Acc" - measured in ms^(-2)

Gyroscope features - those including "Gyro" - measured in radians per second

Features have been normalised and bounded within [1,1]

## The output dataset

### Subject
The first column "subject" relates to the participants; they are numbered from 1 to 30.

### Activity
The second column "activity" relates to the six activities above, described here as walking, walkingup, walkingdown, sitting, standing, and laying.

### Measures
The remainder of the columns, which I shall refer to as the measures, relate to the mean or standard deviation of the features from the original dataset. The descriptions above are combined to give the headings:

### Values

Each element of each row shows the mean of each of the corresponding measure for each subject carrying out each activity, ie each measure has been averaged over all the occasions that each subject completed each activity.

So for example the first row shows the mean for each measure for every time subject 1 carried out the laying activity. (Activities are now shown in alphabetical order within each subject.)
